# PlantLTRdb
PlantLTRdb: An interactive database of plant LTR-Retrotransposons

This repository contain: 

1- The perl script used to identify LTR-RTs gene chimera based on LTR-Retrotransposons localization in genome sequence. The Perl script compared the gene start and end with the start and end of LTR-RT within the genome. LTR-RT was considered a LTR-RT gene chimera if it was located within the gene start and end coordinates provided by the gene annotation in the GFF files.

2- R scripts used to perform the correlation analysis to reveal the relationship between plant genome size, LTR-RT insertion age, and LTR-RT length.
